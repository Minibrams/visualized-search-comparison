# Visualized search comparison
This is a little showcasing of why binary search is so much faster than linear search. 

I have used this to generate some excitement about mathematics and programming for highschool students who are considering getting a bachelors/masters in Software Engineering or Computer Science. 
It serves as an interactive way of showing them that very little (and very easy to understand) mathematics can lead to unbelievably large improvements in terms of time complexity in programs.

## How do I use it
Download all the files, open `index.html` in a browser. The rest should be self-explanatory from there.
